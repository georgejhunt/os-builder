This module configures the resultant image to use a specific activity group
within the Sugar Activity Update control panel applet.

It also causes all of the activities from that group to be downloaded and
installed in the build.

You must specify the activity group URL in the configuration. Example:

[sugar_activity_group]
url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activities/G1G1


The install_activities option (default 1) can be set to 0 to disable the
build-time parsing/download/installation of activities from the activity
group URL. This will cause the activity group URL to be written into the
resultant build but the specified activities will not be downloaded or
installed. e.g.:

[sugar_activity_group]
url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activities/G1G1
install_activities=0


By default, the activity group will be written to the system-wide configuration file /etc/olpc-update/activity-groups. The activity_group_systemwide option
can be disabled in order to use the /home/olpc/Activities/.groups location
instead (note that this file resides outside of the OS, so cannot be updated
with an OS update). e.g.:

[sugar_activity_group]
url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activities/G1G1
activity_group_systemwide=0


Some builds may skip some activities that are in the activity group,
without having to change the activity group.

[sugar_activity_group]
url=http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Activities/G1G1
skip=org.laptop.SimpleEnglishWikipedia
