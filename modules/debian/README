Notes to myself:

* We'll skip all of the kickstart stuff -- ksmain, kspkglist kspost
* copy all of the rootfs generated by debootstrap to location where the ks image gets mounted. -- during build
* Copy rootfs to fs-mnt -- during mount
* Discovered that signing uses preimage -- so pack all of our changes in mountfs
   50 -- cpy_tree2mount
   (58 mate desktop inserted here)
   60 -- start_config.sh make changes that do not require chroot
   65 -- accumulate script to do in chroot
   (70 desktop chroot goes here)
   90 -- actually do the chroot (for arm, copy the accumulated rootfs, and chroot script to arm device)
   This path for arm assumes that the configured image will come back into os-builder as a raw image (folder /root/incoming) for packaging
* make all of the chroot additions -- during mountfs
* determine the size by using du on the tree -- during image -- overhead is 1.25 x du report
* try to get the sd generation routines to work as normally
