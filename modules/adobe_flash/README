This module installs Adobe Flash in the build.

***** WARNING *****

Adobe Flash has a proprietary license which prevents redistribution.
It will be in violation of the license to distribute your resultant build
unless you have received special permission from Adobe.

You can request such permission on the Adobe website.


For platforms where Adobe provides a Flash RPM package (x86, at the time of
writing), there is no configuration, simply include this module in your
configuration.

For other platforms (e.g. ARM), you must specify the local filesystem path
to libflashplayer.so which you have obtained for your platform (ask OLPC for
info), as follows:

[adobe_flash]
plugin_path=/path/to/libflashplayer.so




== Notes on the Adobe Flash RPM ==

The standard Fedora RPM distributed by Adobe breaks the rules of packaging and
conditionally installs files based on the package set present on the system at
time of installation -- it only installs the plugin if the web browser is
installed prior to the installation of Flash.

For this reason, if you simply add the Flash package as an extra package in
the build, it is possible (and likely?) to be installed before the browser,
meaning that Flash doesn't actually work in your resultant image, even
though the RPM was included.

The workaround is to use this module, which adds the Adobe repository to the
build and yum repository configuration, includes the package in the build,
and includes a small amount of hackery to make sure that the plugin
installation is performed after installation of all other packages.


== Security Considerations ==

The Adobe Flash plugin is most appropriate for use with Flash learning
content that is kept secure from tampering.  At time of writing, it is
not needed for video playback on YouTube and many other sites.  Those
sites now use HTML5, and the HTML5 support in Firefox 35 on Fedora 20
works well.

When deploying a build with Adobe Flash for general use, deploy
additional security precautions:

- network boundary filtering, to prevent malicious Flash execution,

- a security update delivery mechanism, so that when the next
  vulnerability is being exploited the laptops in the field can be
  protected.

If these precautions are not taken, the risk of remote code execution
is high.
