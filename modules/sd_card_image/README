This module creates ext4 SD card images from the build output. These
images contain partition tables and 2 partitions.

These images are in the "ZD" format, suitable for flashing via OpenFirmware's
fs-update command. Corresponding .zsp files are produced too. To disable
.zd/.zsp creation, set the make_zd option to 0 (default is 1).

A single disk image is produced, with it's size automatically
calculated based on the size of the data included in the image, plus a small
amount of free space. The system will resize the partition and filesystem to
fill the media during first boot. Therefore, other than loading the module,
no configuration is usually necessary.

A "keep_disk_image" option is available, which can be used to retain the
raw disk image file (basically a file that looks like a block device) that was
used to produce the ZD image, which you could flash with Linux using the "dd"
command.

For example:

[sd_card_image]
keep_disk_image=1

The output files will be:

	osXX.zd
	osXX.zsp
	osXX.zd.disk.img.tar.gz

The raw image file is archived in tar (in sparse mode) and then compressed with
gzip. Tar preserves the sparseness of the file (the fact that some part of the
image is made up of unallocated disk blocks). To disable this
archiving/compression, set the compress_disk_image option to 0 (default is 1).
