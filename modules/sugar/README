This module adds the Sugar learning environment to the build.

It has optional configuration options which let you change the hidden
activities list, and a list of protected activities to disable erasing
an activity.

All accept comma-separated lists of activity IDs.

Example:

[sugar]

# show the normally hidden terminal activity
show_activities=
	org.laptop.Terminal

# hide the normally visible IRC activity
hide_activities=
	org.sugarlabs.IRC

# protect certain activities from erase
protected_activities=org.laptop.WebActivity,
	org.laptop.Terminal,
	org.laptop.Log

--

favorites_view_del abd favorites_view_add are deprecated, because with
Sugar 0.107.0.olpc.3 and later all activities are favorites unless
they are listed the activities.hidden file supplied by the Sugar
package.
